"""
ExoLife Pipeline System.

This module provides a comprehensive, centralized pipeline system
for data processing workflows with DAG-based orchestration.

The primary workflow approach is through DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
orchestration which provides advanced dependency management, parallel
execution, retry logic, and error handling.

Submodules:
- dag: DAG workflow orchestration system (primary approach)
- executor: DAG execution engines with parallel/sequential modes
