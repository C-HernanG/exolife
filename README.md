# ExoLife: Predicting Exoplanet Habitability to Support Astrobiological Discovery

This project is oriented toward developing a machine learning model capable of estimating the habitability of exoplanets from astrophysical data, with the aim of supporting astrobiological research and exoplanetary exploration. The model is trained on mixed-origin data, combining observational measurements from public astronomical catalogs (such as the NASA Exoplanet Archive and the PHL Exoplanet Catalog), simulated planetary parameters, and derived metrics like equilibrium temperature, stellar flux, or Earth Similarity Index. By integrating heterogeneous sources of information, the system aims to produce a more comprehensive and generalizable habitability estimator applicable to a wide range of known and future exoplanets.

## Project Goals

- Estimate exoplanet habitability using real and simulated astrophysical features.
- Support research in astrobiology and planetary science.
- Develop a generalizable model applicable to both cataloged and hypothetical planets.
- Provide an open framework for reproducible experimentation and future integration.
