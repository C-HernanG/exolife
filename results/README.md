# Results

This directory contains the outputs and results from ExoLife experiments and analysis.

## Structure

- **Model Outputs**: Trained models, predictions, and evaluation metrics
- **Experiment Results**: MLflow experiment artifacts and logs
- **Analysis Reports**: Generated reports and visualizations
- **Benchmarks**: Performance and accuracy benchmarks

## Usage

Results are automatically generated by:
- Training pipelines (`make up-gpu`)
- Analysis scripts (`make analyze-data`)
- Model evaluation and testing
- Benchmark runs (`make benchmark`)

**Note**: Results may contain large files. Consider using `.gitignore` patterns for version control.
